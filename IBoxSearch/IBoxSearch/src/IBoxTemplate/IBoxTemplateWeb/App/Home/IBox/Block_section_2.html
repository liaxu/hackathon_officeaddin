        <p>For SOAP specifications, if it is discovered that the schema is less restrictive than the protocol, include the following text:</p>
        <blockquote>In the following sections, the schema definition might be less restrictive than the processing rules imposed by the protocol. The WSDL in this specification matches the WSDL that shipped with the product and provides a base description of the schema. The text that introduces the WSDL specifies additional restrictions that reflect actual Microsoft product behavior. For example, the schema definition might allow for an element to be empty, null, or not present, but the behavior of the protocol as specified restricts the same elements to being non-empty, not null, and present.</blockquote>

                <b>Exchange:</b> Use the following boilerplate text for Web service specifications:

        <blockquote>In the following sections, the schema definition might differ from the processing rules imposed by the protocol. The WSDL in this specification provides a base description of the protocol. The schema in this specification provides a base description of the message syntax. The text that specifies the WSDL and schema might specify restrictions that reflect actual protocol behavior. For example, the schema definition might allow for an element to be empty, null, or not present, but the behavior of the protocol as specified restricts the same elements to being non-empty, not null, or present. </span></blockquote>
        <p>Otherwise, do not add any text after the Messages heading. The heading for this section should be followed immediately by the heading for section 2.1.</p>
        <p>The following standards apply to all subsections within the Messages section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>All programming elements (messages, fields, elements, attributes, parameters, data types, etc.) must be formatted according to the <span sdata="link"><a href="b312f5e3-3fc7-4e44-9ba7-bc46d4ea3acb.aspx">Programming Element Formatting Guidelines</a></span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For inline comments in code examples of any type of protocol, use phrases only. Do not append any closing punctuation. Do not capitalize the first word of the phrase.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For block-style code comments, use sentences or phrases. If the comment is a complete sentence, append closing punctuation, such as a period, to the end of it. If it is a phrase, do not append any closing punctuation.</p>
