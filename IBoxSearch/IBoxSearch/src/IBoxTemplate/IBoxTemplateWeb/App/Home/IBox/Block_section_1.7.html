        <p>Follow all authoring guidelines described in <span sdata="link"><a href="8418447e-77fc-4074-b94c-0b4bbe6df41b.aspx">General Authoring Guidelines</a></span>.</p>
        <p>If there are neither versioning aspects of the protocol nor relevant information about capability negotiation, per the information below, do not delete this section. Instead, ensure that the first and only sentence in this section is "None."</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Version information</h3>
        <div class="subsection">
            <p>The first part of this section should be a bulleted list of items with references and links to sections where versioning aspects of the protocol are specified in detail. Present list items in the following order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Supported Transports</b> - Does an aspect of the protocol go over SMB, raw IP, or something else?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Protocol Versions</b> - Where does the protocol send version information?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Security and Authentication Methods</b> - Which authentication protocols are supported? Where does the specification provide those details?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Localization</b> - What happens if the protocol returns localized strings in a request or a response, such as an error string or user data? If the data is to be stored or displayed without context or negotiation of locale, the protocol has no localization-dependent behaviors. Otherwise, identify the localization-dependent behavior. An example is a response that specifies a locale identifier as the locale to which the message applies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Capability Negotiation</b> - Are there version dependencies? Are there cases where different products, product versions, or implementations within the same product demonstrate significantly different behavior?</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a specific item in the list does not apply to the protocol, omit it from the list but maintain the order above for any other items that do apply.</p>
            <p>If the list contains more than one item, introduce it with the following sentence.</p>
            <blockquote>This specification covers versioning issues in the following areas:</blockquote>
            <p>If the list contains only one item, do not format it as a list. Instead, format it as a stand-alone paragraph with the appropriate information and a link to the relevant section in the specification.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="ExchangeOnly">
                    <b>Exchange:</b> For Exchange Web Services SOAP protocols, if the protocol uses a date/time format, or if the MailboxCulture element is used to specify the culture of the mailbox, include this information in the Localization section.
            </p>
            <p>Use the following text for the Security and Authentication Methods section:</p><blockquote>This protocol relies on the web server that is hosting it to perform authentication.</blockquote><p>In the Capability Negotiation section, provide information about how to get the target server version to determine which operations can be used, and which service endpoint to use.</span></p>
