    <h2>Standard text and formatting</h2>
    <p>Follow all authoring guidelines described in General Authoring Guidelines.</p>
    <p>Section 1.1 should be organized and terms should be listed in ascending alphabetical order (A to Z). Acronyms and abbreviations can appear in the glossary as the spelled out term with the acronym or abbreviation in parentheses, even if only the acronym is used in the body of the document.</P>
    <p>If a term has more than one more definition, list the term along with its multiple definitions, marked with number (1), (2) and so on. For example:</p>
    <p>contact: (1) An object of the contact class that represents a company or person whom a user can contact.
    (2) A person, company, or other entity that is stored in a directory and is associated with one or more unique identifiers and attributes (2), such as an Internet message address or login name.</p>
    <p>When a single term is used within the same document with multiple definitions, in the body of the document, each instance should indicate the number of the applicable definition by appending it to the term and enclosing that number in parentheses: for example, contact (1) and contact (2).</p>
    <p>The last item in the Glossary section should be the standard entry for normative terms:</p>
    <p>MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:These terms (in all caps) are used as described in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.</p>
    <p>In that entry, [RFC2119] should be formatted as a normative citation.</p>
    <p>If the specification does not contain any glossary terms or normative terms, delete the standard introduction from the specification.</p>
