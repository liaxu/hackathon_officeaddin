    <h2>Standard text and formatting</h2>
    <p>The following boilerplate should appear at the end of section 1.0 of all specifications except those based on the Structure, Algorithm, and Overview templates:</P>
    <P>Sections 1.8, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative and can contain the terms MAY, SHOULD, MUST, MUST NOT, and SHOULD NOT as defined in RFC 2119. Sections 1.5 and 1.9 are also normative but cannot contain those terms. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.</P>
    <p>For specifications based on the Structure/BFF template, use the following boilerplate:</p>
    <p>Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative and can contain the terms MAY, SHOULD, MUST, MUST NOT, and SHOULD NOT as defined in RFC 2119. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.</p>
    <p>For specifications based on the Algorithm template, use the following boilerplate:</p>
    <p>Section 2 of this specification is normative and can contain the terms MAY, SHOULD, MUST, MUST NOT, and SHOULD NOT as defined in RFC 2119. Section 1.6 is also normative but cannot contain those terms. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative.</p>
    <p>Do not begin the introduction with the phrase "This document specifies..." or "This document describes...". The purpose of the introduction is to describe the algorithm, file format, extension, or protocol, not the specification. It is not necessary to include text about the specification itself.</p>
    <p>On first mention of a protocol, algorithm, extension, or file format in a document, use the full name of the protocol, algorithm, extension, or file format. On subsequent mentions, use "this protocol", "this algorithm", "this extension", or "this file format." When using the full name of a protocol, capitalize "Protocol"; for example, "the SpellCheck Web Service Protocol." You can repeat the full protocol/algorithm/extension/file format name if required for clarity.</p>
    <h2>Required elements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On first mention in a document or as needed for clarity, use the full name of the protocol, algorithm, extension, or file format that is being specified</li>
        <li>Briefly describe the purpose of the protocol, algorithm, extension, or file format</li>
        <li>Boilerplate identifying normative sections of the specification must appear at end of this section</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Inappropriate elements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using "This document specifies..." or "This document describes..." in the introduction.</li>
        <li>Product names, unless a product name is part of the name of the protocol or format</li>
        <li>Normative terms, as specified in RFC 2119; for example, MUST, SHOULD, and MAY</li>
        <li>Lowercase versions of normative terms; for example, must, should, and may</li>
        <li>Normative citations</li>
        <li>Product behavior notes</li>
        <li>Footnotes</p>
        <li>Diagrams, figures, or other art</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Code examples</li>
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The "P" in protocol is capitalized when it appears in a protocol name; for example, "the SpellCheck Web Service Protocol"</li>
        <li>Describes the purpose of the protocol, algorithm, structure, or file format</li>
        <li>Uses the long name of the protocol | extension | algorithm | file format on first mention and refers to "this protocol" | "this extension" | "this algorithm" | "this file format" thereafter unless the long name is needed for clarity</li>
        <li>Does not use normative terms, as specified in RFC 2119</li>
        <li>Does not say "This document specifies..." or "This document describes..." in the introduction.</li>
        <li>Does not use the lowercase versions of normative terms</li>
        <li>Does not use the specification short name ([MS-xxxx]) to refer to the protocol, algorithm, or file format</li>
        <li>Uses informative citations sparingly</li>
        <li>Uses glossary terms sparingly</li>
        <li>Does not contain normative citations or other normative content</li>
        <li>Does not contain pseudocode or code examples</li>
        <li>Does not contain footnotes or product behavior notes</li>
        <li>Does not contain diagrams, figures, or other art</li>
        <li>Does not contain tables</li>
        <li>Boilerplate identifying the normative sections of the specification appears at the end of this section</li>
