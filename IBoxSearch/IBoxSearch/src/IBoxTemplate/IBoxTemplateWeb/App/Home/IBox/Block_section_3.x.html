        <p>Follow all authoring guidelines described in <span sdata="link"><a href="8418447e-77fc-4074-b94c-0b4bbe6df41b.aspx">General Authoring Guidelines</a></span>.</p>
        <p>Include this section only as applicable for a block protocol; if a particular role does not apply for the protocol, do not include a section for that role.</p>
        <p>If there are no client or server roles to specify for a sproc protocol, the first and only paragraph in the corresponding section should be "None."</p>
        <p>If the protocol can be described more easily by using a state machine diagram, provide such a diagram in this section. The diagram should use a subset of the UML 2 state machine diagram format, which is available in Visio 2003 and later. It is recommended that you omit from the diagram any actions and activities that occur within the protocol. Such actions and activities are typically complex and can best be specified in the text of subsections 3.1.x, where they additionally serve as a definitive reference for protocol behavior.</p>
        <p>In the diagram, use a rectangle with rounded corners to represent a state.</p>

        <p />
        <p>To represent the initial pseudo-state, use a black solid circle.</p>
        <img alt="3_x_InitialState" src="../media/IBox_3_x_InitialState.jpg" />
        <p />
        <p>To represent the final pseudo-state, use a black solid circle enclosed in another circle.</p>
        <img alt="3_x_FinalState" src="../media/IBox_3_x_FinalState.jpg" />
        <p />
        <p>To represent transitions between states, use a directed arc. In the arc label, specify the trigger and, if applicable, a condition enclosed in square brackets.</p>
