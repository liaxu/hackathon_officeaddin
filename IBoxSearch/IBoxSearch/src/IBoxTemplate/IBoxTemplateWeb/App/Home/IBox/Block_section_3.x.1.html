        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If no states are required for the protocol or algorithm to work, do not delete this section. Instead, ensure that the first and only sentence in this section is "None."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If any states are required for the protocol or algorithm to work, the first paragraph of this section should be:</p>
                <p>This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation maintains to participate in this &lt;protocol/algorithm&gt;. The described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the &lt;protocol/algorithm&gt; behaves. This specification does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this specification.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If applicable, the section should then list the required states in the following format:</p>
                <p><b>state name:</b> A/An/The + &lt;brief description that forms a complete sentence&gt;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p><b>Base URL:</b> The portion of the <b>Request-URI</b> that matches the base rule in the ABNF, as specified in section <u>2.2.1.3.1</u>.</p>
                <p><b>Query Parameters:</b> The parameters in the query component of the <b>Request-URI</b>, as specified in section <u>2.2.1.3.2</u> and its subsections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If another protocol or algorithm directly sets or gets the value of abstract data model (ADM) elements, include the following statement and include "(Public)" after the name of the ADM element. Otherwise, omit the statement.</p>
                <p>Note that the abstract interface notation '(Public)' indicates that the abstract data model element can be directly accessed from outside this &lt;protocol/algorithm&gt;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the protocol or algorithm directly sets or gets the value of ADM elements of another protocol or algorithm, that is, (Public) elements of another protocol or algorithm, call out the references explicitly. For example:</p>
                <p>This protocol includes the following ADM elements, which are directly accessed from &lt;protocol name&gt; as specified in [MS-ABCD] section 3.1.1:</p>
                <p><b>CurrentCounter</b></p>
                <p><b>MaxCounter</b></p>
                <p>The following elements are specific to this protocol:</p>
                <p><b>Base URL:</b> The portion of the Request-URI that matches the base rule, as specified in section 2.2.1.3.1.</p>
                <p><b>Query parameters:</b> The parameters in the query component of the Request-URI, as specified in section 2.2.1.3.2.</p>
                <p>Use the same element name that is used in the referenced technical document. If you cannot use the same name, you must provide a mapping between the names.</p>
