<h2 class="heading">Standard text and formatting</h2>
<div id="sectionSection0" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style="">
   <p><b>Note:</b> &nbsp;Documents that are created using the GenDox authoring tool will have this section formatted automatically as long as each informative reference is styled using the GenDox "Informative Reference" style at least once in the body of the document. </p>
   <p>Follow all authoring guidelines described in <span sdata="link"><a href="8418447e-77fc-4074-b94c-0b4bbe6df41b.aspx">General Authoring Guidelines</a></span>.</p>
   <p>The syntax for references is very specific and must be used for all citations and in all specifications. The Interoperability team is responsible for defining and providing the text of a citation when they review and approve a reference request.</p>
   <p>If a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) appendix is present, the following reference to service contracts MUST be included:</p>
   <p>[MSDN-WCFSC] Microsoft Corporation, "Designing Service Contracts", <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=285586" >http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733070.aspx</a></p>
   <p>Apply the following formatting rules to citations in this section:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <p>If the specification does not cite any informative references or use any glossary terms, do not delete this section. Instead, ensure that the first and only sentence in this section is "None."</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>List references in ascending alphanumeric order by the technical document short name.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Use only the exact text specified and approved by the Interoperability team, as indicated in the GenDox Shared Content pane References tab.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Enclose the short name of the reference in square brackets ([]).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Append a period (.) to all references that DO NOT end in a URL. Reference entries that end in a URL should not contain end punctuation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Use FWLinks for links to documents that are not Open Specifications technical documents. Although the URL that displays in the references section is the URL of the link target, the actual link is an FWLink for links to documents that are not Open Specifications documents. The Interop references editor provides the FWLink when approving a reference request. For example, the destination URL for the pseudocode standard is <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89842" >http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89842</a>. If the destination is an Open Specifications technical document, the destination URL should be a .pdf file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>If there is an official standards designation for the technical document, omit spaces in the bracketed citation; for example, RFC2119, 802.1D-2004, and FIPS199.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>If there isn't an official standards designation for the technical document, such as a recommendation by the W3C, use an abbreviated form of the technical document title for the bracketed citation; for example, W3C-PNG, HTML, and CSS-LEVEL2.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Citing KB articles outside of the Product Behavior appendix is discouraged. Verify that citations outside of the Product Behavior appendix are not implementation-specific.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Use FWLinks as the destination URLs for links to documents that are not Office technical documents. The Office Interoperability team provides FWLinks for you when they approve a reference request.</p>
